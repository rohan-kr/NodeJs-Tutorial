Unit Testing is nothing but breaking down the logic of our application in to small units and verifying that each unit works as we expected.

TDD (Test Driven Development)
TAD (Test After Development)


BDD : Behavior Driven Development : It is a spcialized version of TDD which specifes what need to be tested in the perspective of business requirement


TDD / TAD Vocabulary (Test Centric only developers can understand the terms)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

class with testcases : TestSuite
Methods to get execute before all the test cases  : TestFixureSetup
Methods to get execute after all the test cases  : TestFixureTearDown
Methods to get execute before each and every test case  : Setup
Methods to get execute after each and every test case  : teardown
Test case method is called as : Test


BDD (Business Centric any one can understand the terms)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

class with testcases : Describe
Methods to get execute before all the test cases  : before
Methods to get execute after all the test cases  : after
Methods to get execute before each and every test case  : beforeEach
Methods to get execute after each and every test case  : afterEach
Test case method is called as : It

Story : Registered User need to login into the system.When he supply the valid credentials he can access the home page else stay in login page

Valid Login Scenario (GWT) :
Given:
	The User is in login page
	And the user enters valid userid
	And the user enter valid password
When:
	The user logs in
Then:
	User is redirected to home page 

InValid Login Scenario(GWT) : 
____________________________

Given:
	The User is in login page
	And the user enters valid userid
	And the user enter invalid password
When:
	The user logs in
Then:
	User is redirected to login page 

SUT : System under Test

Mocha (Testing Framework where we can write our test cases which follows both TDD and BDD Approach)

Chai (Assertion Library TDD / BDD(Should,expect) )

Istanbul : Code Coverage

SuperTest : Test Http Endpoints
